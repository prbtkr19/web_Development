<!-- CSS Selectors
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value) -->


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
} 
</style>
</head>
<body>

<p>Every paragraph will be affected by the style.</p>
<p id="para1">Me too!</p>
<p>And me!</p>

</body>
</html>


<!-- The CSS id Selector
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.

The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!

To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 id="para1">Hello World!</h1>
<p>This paragraph is not affected by the style.</p>

</body>
</html>

<!-- An id name cannot start with a number! -->
<!-- The CSS class Selector
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.

To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="center">Red and center-aligned heading</h1>
<p class="center">Red and center-aligned paragraph.</p> 

</body>
</html>
<!-- You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
p.center {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="center">This heading will not be affected</h1>
<p class="center">This paragraph will be red and center-aligned.</p> 

</body>
</html>

<!-- The CSS Universal Selector
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<p>Every element on the page will be affected by the style.</p>
<p id="para1">Me too!</p>
<p>And me!</p>

</body>
</html>
<!-- The CSS Grouping Selector
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.

Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions): -->

h1 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }
  
  h2 {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }
  
  p {
    text-align: center;
    color: red;
  }

  <!-- It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.

To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

Example
In this example we have grouped the selectors from the code above:  -->

h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
